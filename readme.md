This site corresponds to the reproducibility kit for the paper *"Architecture Optimization using Surrogate-based Incremental Learning for Quality-attribute Analyses"* accepted at ICSA 2025.

We provide the following assets:
* Datasets for the *ST+* and *CoCoME* case studies
* *Jupyter* notebooks to run the Machine Learning models, including the surrogate model
* Additional scripts to compute metrics and charts, based on the (intermediate) results of the notebooks

We recommend running the notebooks in *Google Colab* using Python 3.10.12.

Alternatively, a local Python environment can be set up using the *requirements.txt* file.
